    We pay too little attention to how we think, and just roll with it.
    <br>Sometimes we want to change how we think, but how can you do that if you don't know what your changing from?
    <br>This isn't mind reading, this is self-reflection and empathy. Understanding yourself is the first step to truly understanding others.
    <br>Empathetic people thrive, they are driven to do something about the chaos amidst all the nations, and they are what WE need to be.
    <br><br>Yes,<br><strong>self-reflection & empathy are the core of living your best life, and helping others do the same.</strong>
